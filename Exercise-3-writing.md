# Exercise 3 - Written assignment

In the *Sustainable cities and mobilities* and *Mobility analytics* lessons this week, we went through a few ideas related to how mobilities relates to sustainability and how it is possible to analyze observed spatial mobility analytically. 

For this exercise, we recommend that you first write your text into Google Docs (or some other text editor), and once you are ready, paste the text into this Markdown document located at **your personal copy of the exercise** (e.g. `exercise-1-htenkanen`). You can add your text here using the editing functionalities of GitHub: click the pencil icon on the top-right side of this document (it will start an editor), then modify this document, and commit (i.e. save) your changes (to be able to do that, you need to add a commit message like `Update docs`). 

**Note for those doing the exercise in pairs**:

Only the `code ninja` should be cloning the Exercise repository as she/he/they will the **lead** on this exercise. The `philosopher`, i.e. you who will be leading the work for this written assignment should ask the `code ninja` to provide you [collaboration access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to their copy of the Exercise. See more information from the [course page](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/pair-programming.html).  

## Spatial mobility and sustainability (10 points)

Write 1-2 pages of text in English where you explain:
 
 - What kind of issues increased mobility causes related to sustainability? 
 - What kind of possible solutions there are that could help to solve or at least improve the situation related to current mobility crisis?
 - When analyzing mobility data, what challenges there exist related to the nature of the data? Are there any workarounds to overcome these challenges?
 
Use the lesson materials and the recommended readings (optional) as a source of information for answering to these.
